                 <p>
                    During my career, I went a long way from a junior PHP developer to a senior full-stack developer in a big company. <br />
                    Worked in various companies and with various technologies, primarily with .Net C# stack, ASP .Net and .Net Core.<br /><br />
                    I am always aspired to learn new technologies and tools, to make work for business better and faster.<br />
                    Willing to know what is the best fit to the project needs. Want to have strong background knowledge.<br />
                    Trying to do my best to use my knowledge in problem-solving tasks.<br/><br />
                    I have good spoken English and fluent Ukrainan and Russian.
                    <br /><br />
                    Interested in the Data science projects and in cloud technologies and have a blog on Medium, where Iâ€™m writing about Data science. <br />
                    Passed AWS Certified Developer Associate exam and will be excited to use my knowledge as a developer and help the company to grow.
